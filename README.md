#CHECKERS

Hi there! So you want to play checkers (or is it draughts). Well you came to the
right place. 

To jump straight in and start playing just go
[here](https://jamesswatton.github.io/checkers).

This was meant to be a logic challenge of sorts. I wanted to try making a game
that I knew the rules to but had no idea how to implement in code. I decided,
for better or for worse, to not look at anyone elses code and just got stuck in. 
The result is this. Perhaps not the most elegant solution but it works!

I also wanted to work with vinalla javascript as a framework would clearly just
be bloat for this kind of project. Also, the use of modules felt like overkill
too, though some of the board creation and rendering code could work nicely if
packaged up - for use in other board games. 

Enjoy!
